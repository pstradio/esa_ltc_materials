This package contains the jupyter notebooks for the "Soil Moisture" and "Drought" exercises held at the `ESA Land Training Course 2022 <https://landtraining2022.esa.int/>`_.

The package is designed to run on `mybinder.org <mybinder.org/>`_. To open a notebook in your browser click on one of the following badges. Please note that opening the files on mybinder may take a few minutes (`it takes longer if the notebook was not used for some time <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/user-guidelines.html#performance-and-speed>`_).

Data used in the tutorials is automatically downloaded when using binder (see the file ``postBuild``). However, if you want to download the data manually you can do this at https://cloud.geo.tuwien.ac.at/s/cNoJcXojZQyTfWG

At some point the materials might not be available anymore, in this case you can open an issue on github and we will send you the files.
